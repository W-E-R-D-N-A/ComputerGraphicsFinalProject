# ComputerGraphicsFinalProject
A WebGL project which renders a 3d Medieval castle-themed room.

The book shelf can be moved to reveal a hidden door using the 'a' key.
The 'b' key resets the scene.

When using local textures it is typically necessary to input the following line to the console:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application>chrome --allow-file-access-from-files file:[texture directory]
*One's chosen browser directory may vary.
